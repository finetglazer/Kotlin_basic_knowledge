/*
    - About the version of SDK
    We have different versions like android 11(api 30), 12(api 31), 13(api 32),...
    -> This is helpful for supporting each version of application for each type of applications like screen, performance, mic, camera,...
    -> Now it's not time for learning it
    - About Groovy DSL and Kotlin DSL
    + Groovy DSL: checking at runtime and Kotlin DSL at compile time  -> Kotlin DSL is like java at this point
    + Groovy DSL is flexible with code like the characteristic of single quote with string type,
    , while the syntax of the latter is relatively the same as Java.

    So how we can choose between two these:
    + Project requirement: With the flexibility of the project, Groovy is better fit
    + Safety and IDE support: Kotlin is the way to go
    + Team familiarity: if we are familiar with java, kotlin dsl is where we should go

    - Main file in Kotlin
    In java, to make a runnable file, we use function main in a class. However, this doesn't happen in Kotlin,
    we create a main function outside classes like C++,
